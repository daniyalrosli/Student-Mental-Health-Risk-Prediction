Student Mental Health Risk Prediction is a machine learning project designed to predict the risk of mental health issues among students using data-driven techniques. The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that identifies students who may be at risk of experiencing mental health challenges based on demographic, academic, and lifestyle factors.

By utilizing a variety of machine learning algorithms and feature engineering techniques, this project aims to support early intervention strategies for improving student well-being.

Features:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and scaling features to ensure optimal model performance.
Predictive Modeling: Implement various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting to predict the likelihood of mental health issues.
Evaluation Metrics: Use of accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC curve to assess model performance.
Feature Importance: Analysis of the most influential factors contributing to student mental health risks.
Cross-Validation: Ensures that the model generalizes well across different subsets of the dataset.

Dataset:
The dataset used in this project contains information about students, including demographic details, academic performance, and lifestyle habits. The target variable indicates whether a student has experienced mental health challenges.

Models Used:

Logistic Regression
Random Forest
XGBoost (Gradient Boosting)

How It Works:

Data Preprocessing: Prepares the data for training, including handling missing values and feature scaling.
Model Training: Several machine learning models are trained and tuned using the training dataset.
Prediction: The trained model predicts the mental health risk for new, unseen data.
Evaluation: Model performance is evaluated using various metrics to ensure accuracy and reliability.

Project Goals:

Improve the accuracy and reliability of student mental health predictions.
Identify the key factors contributing to mental health issues in students.
Provide insights that can help institutions with early interventions to support student well-being.
